teen-protocol-for-ns2
=====================
TEEN is a routing protocol for finding path from source to destination.
We have implemented this algorithm based on concept of TEEN tree structure.
After implementing it we have checked the working in ns2 simulator.
We have checked it against standard AODV protocol and it was found that TEEN has better performance.
